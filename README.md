# souk
An e-commerce app built with React and MobX

Souk is a scalable web application for e-commerce. The features currently supported by souk include the ability for sellers to add items to sell on souk, and for buyers to browse through items currently being sold and add/remove items from the shopping cart. To manage the complex application state, the state-management library MobX is pulled in to work alongside React in order to offer a predictable, efficient user experience.
